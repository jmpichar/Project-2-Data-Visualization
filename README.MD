Project Description

Build a full-stack data visualization web application that allows the user explore the data interactively.



Requirements

1.      Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

2.      Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:

路        A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)

路        A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

路        A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data

路        A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

3.      Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4.      Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5.      Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.) Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views
